  <h2>Discovering the Issue</h2>

  <p>Before the first release of the tool, I wanted to provide some built-in queries accessible through the client UI out-of-the-box. While building those queries, I ran into an issue where some queries were exceeding the query time limits (even for administrator privileges!). Some queries were taking more than 30 seconds to return.</p>
